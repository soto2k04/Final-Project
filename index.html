Whether you want to focus on increasing your curb appeal with a reimagined front yard, create a backyard retreat with dining and entertaining areas, or both, there are many options and features to consider. Use the information below to start determining what you want in your new landscape.</p>

						<H2>Knowledge</H2>
						<p class="font20 leftmargin">The backyard is where most outdoor home activities happen, whether it’s play time for kids, a family barbecue, or quiet time with a good book. Unlike traditional landscapes of the past, the backyard has become an outdoor space that’s an extension of the home.</p>
						<p class="font20 leftmargin">It’s safe to say that most backyards could use an upgrade as part of any home improvement project, whether they are minor DIY changes or a complete renovation with the help of a landscape design professional. You don’t need a big backyard to make substantial improvements. Even a small urban yard can be transformed into an inviting space where you can maximize enjoyment of your time outdoors. Here are some basic backyard design principles, along with design ideas to get you started</p>

						<H2>Planning</H2>
						<div class="font20 leftmargin">
							<ul>
								<li>Evaluate your site.</li>
								<li>How much space do you have? -- Measure your backyard to get a more accurate idea.</li>
								<li>Is your yard level, sloped, or irregularly shaped?</li>
								<li>What are your existing foundation trees and shrubs, and will you incorporate them into a new design or remove them?</li>
								<li>How does light fall during different parts of the day and throughout the seasons?</li>
								<li>This will help determine plant choice and how to use the space.</li>
								<li>Consider function.</li>
								<li>How do you want to use your backyard space?</li>
								<li>Do you want a play area for children, a place to prepare food, a dining patio, quiet seating area for reading and meditation, dog run, swimming pool, water feature, fire pit, or vegetable garden?</li>
								<li>Prioritize the activities you are most likely to engage in and allow room for ornamental plantings.</li>
								<li>Consider privacy. Small urban lots tend to have more privacy issues than larger suburban properties.</li>
								<li>Does your neighbor’s second story window look down into your backyard?</li>
								<li>Is there an unsightly view that needs screening?</li>
								<li>Is your backyard enclosed by a fence or hedging?</li>
								<li>See more ideas on designing for privacy.</li>
								<li>Divide the backyard into garden rooms. Creating separate areas for different functions will make a backyard feel larger. Connect rooms with pathways or transition areas and use hedging, containers, plant groupings, fencing, or lattice to screen garden rooms. The separation can be solid or semi-open to allow light and glimpses into the adjacent space. Read more about how to design garden rooms.</li>
								<li>Get inspired. Peruse the internet and visit local gardens for ideas. Make a list of attributes you like, such as a patio, fencing, hardscape materials, plants, outdoor kitchen, or furniture.</li>
								<li>Consider scale. Larger suburban properties will have different considerations than small backyards. Choose a bistro set or love seat for a smaller space rather than a full-sized dining ensemble or couch sectional. Stepping stones may be more suitable for a pathway than a full-sized sidewalk. If you have a tiny yard, you may not have room for a pond, but you can still add a water feature such as a birdbath or tabletop fountain. Allow enough room for plants to reach their mature size and use dwarf varieties for smaller areas.</li>
								<li>Choose a style. Pick hardscape, furnishings and plants that will complement your home’s facade. A contemporary fireplace or couch sectional will complement a modern style home, while a fire pit and Adirondack-style furniture are more suited to a bungalow or rustic cabin.</li>
								<li>Draw a design. Make a rough sketch and formulate a basic plan. For more elaborate projects, consult a landscape professional to create a garden design.</li>
								<li>Budget. The cost of a major backyard upgrade can be substantial, and should be determined ahead of time. Get more than one opinion and consider less costly options for hardscaping and furnishings without sacrificing quality. Renovations can be done in stages to spread out costs over time.</li>
